üñ• **Features**

- **Easy Data Input**: Quickly capture crucial meeting details such as date, time, first name, last name, and email through a user-friendly form.
- **Data Storage**: All meetings are stored in a `.json` file, making data retrieval effortless even when offline.
- **Modular Components**: The app‚Äôs architecture revolves around component-based designs. This not only ensures seamless updates in the future but also provides an efficient data flow through `state` and `props`.
- **Validation**: Every input is rigorously validated, ensuring the consistency and accuracy of the data.
- **Sorting Features**: Organize your meetings efficiently! Now sort columns by date, time, status, and name.
- **Unique User Avatars**: Every user gets a distinct avatar next to their name, enhancing recognition.
- **Meeting Management**:
  - **Status Indicators**: Past meetings are marked 'outdated', while upcoming ones are labeled 'pending'. Moreover, meetings can be sorted by their status for quick accessibility.
  - **Safety Precautions**: Prior to deleting any meeting data, users will encounter a confirmation step, minimizing the risk of accidental data loss.
  - **Time Adjustments**: Flexibly edit both the date and time of scheduled meetings.
- **Redux Management**: The entire app benefits from Redux's powerful state management capabilities. With the use of `connect()`, maintaining and accessing state across components has never been easier.
